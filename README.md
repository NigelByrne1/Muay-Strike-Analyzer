The ***Muay Strike Analyzer*** is a training tool used to measure and alanyze the power of Muay Thai Strikes to a punching bag, using a Raspberry Pi equiped with a Sense Hat.

The device is attached to a punching bag, the device captures motiondata such as accelleration and impact force. This data is then transmitted to ThingSpeak for visualization and analysis. This will provide fighters with insights and a way to track performance over time. 

## Tools, Technologies and Equipment

1. **Hardware:**
   - Raspberry Pi 4.
   - Sense HAT for capturing motion data (accelerometer, gyroscope).
   - Straps and fixture to secure the Raspberry Pi to the boxing bag.
   - Active internet connection for transmission

2. **Software:**
   - Python for programming (sensor data collection and processing).
   - ThingSpeak for  data storage and visualization.

3. **Networking/IoT:**
   - MQTT or HTTP?? to send data to ThingSpeak.
   - ThingSpeak API for real-time data visualization.

4. **Possible Extras:**
   - Led on Sense Hat to demonstrate real time power feedback (red for low power, green for high power etc).
   - Use of camera to determine if kicks or punches?
